        h1 About BookBrainz
        p.lead.
          BookBrainz is an online encyclopaedia which contains information
          about published literature. Our aim is to collect and store data
          about every book. magazine, journal or other publication ever
          written.
        
        p
          | BookBrainz is developed by just a small team of volunteers, unlike
          | the MusicBrainz encyclopaedia on which it is based. Nevertheless, we
          | are committed to making BookBrainz the definitive source of
          | publication metadata. We hope to attract many contributors, who will
          | be able to use their knowledge of literature to expand the database
          | through our website. If you think you can help,&nbsp;

        h2 Our Story
        p.
          BookBrainz was conceived in 2011, during a discussion in the
          MusicBrainz IRC channel. It was initially championed by Oliver
          Charles, who was a core MusicBrainz developer at the time, and the
          code was written in Haskell. While a number of people contributed to
          this early version of BookBrainz, it lost momentum after a couple of
          years.
        
        p.
          Another MusicBrainz community member, Sean Burke, who had been
          involved with BookBrainz from the beginning, rekindled the project in
          May 2014, starting from scratch using the node.js framework. Although
          there was an initial burst of activity and good progress made on the
          site design, after a month or so, Sean didn't have time to maintain
          the initial level of activity. 
          
        p.
          Around the time of the annual MusicBrainz summit in 2014, a third
          MusicBrainz community member, Ben Ockmore, started to take an
          interest in the project. New discussions were held in the BookBrainz
          IRC channel, and progress was made on a new node.js site and
          webservice. After a couple of months, the decision was made to switch
          from node.js to Python for the webservice, and progress has continued
          steadily since then.
          
        p.
          From the beginning, BookBrainz was closely tied with the New Edit
          System (NES) for MusicBrainz, which was designed by Oliver to
          introduce a Git-style framework for managing contributions to
          MusicBrainz. Both projects were initially written in Haskell, and
          BookBrainz used an adapted version of NES as its edit system. The NES
          has also been the basis for the edit system in the current iteration
          of BookBrainz.
          
        h2 How We Operate
        p.
          The core components of BookBrainz are the site, the webservice and
          the database. All of these components are running on the MusicBrainz
          sandbox server, which currently meets all of our hosting
          requirements. We anticipate moving to a more powerful server at some
          point in the future, when traffic to the site increases.
          
        p.
          BookBrainz relies on contributions from editors to expand the
          knowledge contained in the database. Editors can add new data to the
          site, fix any errors in the existing information, and create links
          between pieces of information. To acknowledge this vital input, we
          make our data freely available to everyone, for any use. While we
          don't create regular database dumps at this early stage of the
          project, you're welcome to browse the site or use the webservice to
          access data.
