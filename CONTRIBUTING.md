# Contributing to BookBrainz Site

If you're reading this, you're probably creating a Pull Request or planning to do so and that's great!

In order to keep that process as pleasant as possible for all parties and to maintain a nice repository,
please follow the steps below.

## Commits

We try to keep our commit messages readable and concise, this is especially important as they can't be rewrittenâ€”unlike
code.

Thus please follow [this guide](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html) when writing commit messages.
While not recommended, you can always force-push to your fork to fix bad commit messages; it is however not possible to
force-push to this repo.
